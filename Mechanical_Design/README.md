## Design Files

The design was done entirely in Autodesk Fusion 360. This makes the design very accessible as anyone can use Fusion for free with a hobbyist licence (current information, PRIL 2020). To allow people wishing to make a turbine model like this to easily interact with the design files, the full assembly was uploaded in the following formats.

 * Autodesk Fusion 360 files (.f3z)
 * Sutodesk Inventor files (.ipt and .iam files in a zip folder. Contains all components separately as well as the full assembly)
 * .STL files (3D CAD objects for every component can be viewed in one file but has no design history and is not as editable. Syill well suited for manuufacturing) 
* Sketchup files (.skp, Not tested, produced by Fusion 360 exporter)
