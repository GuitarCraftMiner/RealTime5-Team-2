## Project Title: Adaptive Wind Turbine Blade Pitch Control
### Brief Description
The project aims to build a small scale wind turbine model with automated pitch control. It will be able to react to changes in wind speed in real time and adjust the blades to main a safe and stable generator output voltage. The commanded pitch and the generated voltage will be displayed on an external screen.

# Important Note

This project is part of a university course and therefore had time constraints. Due to the fact that the university was forced to close early due to COVID-19, the project was not completed as planned originally. Although the turbine model and most of the software was ready before the closure, there was no possibility of testing them as a system because we could not make the PCB needed for amplification and analogue to digital conversion. We did not have access to any electronic equipment such as oscilloscopes, signal generators or multimeters and the team could no longer meet in person due to the introduced quarantine measures in the UK. Thus, the results seen in the software section in the wiki were only simulated in software.
